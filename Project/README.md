Introduction
============

A non-relational database is a data storage model that does not use a traditional schema of rows and columns. Instead, this model is designed specifically in order to fulfill the requirements of the data that will be stored in the database. These designs may vary from key-value pairs and graph-based databases consisting of edges and vertices, to replicated data in different data centers, so the redundancy of the information can be improved.

Commonly, non-relational databases as MongoDB, Cassandra or Neo4j, allow the developers and data scientists to work with big amounts of data. These different designs raise the performance of the database and make possible to execute different and faster calculations with huge datasets.
The relevance of these calculations come to play in statistical terms when some data science model is trying to express a pattern, and conclude some important characteristic of the original analyzed dataset.

The technologies used for this project were: Cassandra, MongoDB, Phentaho and the programming language R. The data for this project was provided by the teacher.
